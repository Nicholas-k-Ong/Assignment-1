I'm hoping to be in any form of qualitative research, higher ed, or service. I enjoy being a part of an experience in which I can assist in the well-being of those existing within a community, through the means of their own voices and opinions!
Therefore, I'm taking this course so that I can gain a new skill in quantitative research, to aid my abilities in qualitative work. I just want to expand my horizons, so that I can be a well-rounded person in the humanitarian field.
I'm an avid biker, weightlifter, and gamer. I find myself enjoying the process of learning new things, as long as I can quickly pick it up and be good at it.
